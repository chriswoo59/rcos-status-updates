## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Began creating a model

## This Week's Plan

> Instead of a humanoid I found an ogre template online, and will be using that as the base for my character model

## Anything Blocking?

> Not sure if the side view is properly placed, but that is not a worry until I finish the front view

## Notes

> None
